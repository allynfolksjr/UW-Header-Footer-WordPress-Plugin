Introduction



This plugin provides a simple interface that allows you to embed a UW-themed
header/footer into your Wordpress site. It allows you to use UW theming without
having to directly modify the theme file, allowing easy theme and Wordpress
upgrades.

=======

How it works.


The Header & Footer Wizard stores your choices for headers and footers by NetID,
and can create a "SHTML" include file that is based off of your NetID. Whenever
the include is called, it will query the Header & Footer Wizard and place the
choosen header and/or footers into the page.

This plugin uses that dynamically-generated URL to allow you to change your
settings on the fly. Additionally, it will automatically update the code as
there are updates to the stylings.

Finally, it will place the header, footer, and CSS in the proper location on
WordPress. Nifty, eh?

======

Use Information


There are two modes you can run in:

* "Default mode," which will use the default header and footer. If you want to
use the default mode, just activate the plugin: you're done!


* "Custom Mode," which allows you to customize the header & footer as you see
fit.

For custom mode, follow these steps:

1) Go to the header and footer wizard:

https://depts.washington.edu/uweb/tmplgen/


2) Enter in your contact email and site URL. Continue through the steps choosing
what options you'd prefer.


3) Once you're complete and at the "Code Preference" step, choose "Include" and
click on "generate my code."

4) Activate the plugin and go to the "UW Theming" screen. Uncheck "default" and
enter in the NetID of where you ran the theming wizard. This is probably your
personal NetID, but if you're not sure, go to weblogin.washington.edu to see
what you're logged in as.

5) Click on "save" and check out your site. It should be updated with your new
options!

Notes


* Your theme must have wp_head(); and wp_footer();, otherwise the plugin will have 
nowhere to hook into.
